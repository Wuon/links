## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Install and setup**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Wuon/links.git
cd links
npm install
npm start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

2.  **Customizing your profile**

To update the title and description modify `gatsby-config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Your desired title`,
    description: `Your desired description.`,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

To update the profile picture, replace `avatar.png` in `./src/images` with an image of your choice

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ avatar.png
```

3.  **Customizing your links**

To update the links you would like to display, head over to `./src/data/socials/socials.json`

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ socials
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ socials.json
```

The format which the data is read is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "platform": "Instagram",
    "username": "danielktwu",
    "icon": "../../images/instagram.png",
    "link": "https://www.instagram.com/danielktwu/"
  },
  ...
]
```

Note that `username`, `icon`, and `link` are optional as some platforms don't have a direct link.
